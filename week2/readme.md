# Variables and Data Types
## Variables
Placeholder in memory to hold data that can change and its has a specific data type, the **data type** will specify how much space is needed in the memory.

## Variable declaration
###Syntax:
	dataType variableName;
### Semantic:
- Take a space in memory and give it a name and data type


## Variable Assignment
###Syntax:
	variableName = Expression:
###Semantics:
- Evaluate the expression
- Store the value into the placeholder with corresponding variable name

## Variable Definition
###Syntax:
	dataType variableName = Expression ;
###Semantics:
- Take a space in memory and give it a name and data type
- Evaluate the expression
- Store the value into the placeholder with corresponding variable name

##Example: 
#### Declaration:
	int num;
#### Assignment:
	num = 100;
#### Definition:
	int num2 = 100;

## Data Types
## Primitive Data Types:
Primitive data type you can only perform operations on them, but they don't have any methods attached to them
###Numericals:
#### Integers:
-	byte				8 bits
-	short				16 bits
-	int					32 bits
-	long				64 bits

#### Floating Point Numbers:
-	float 				32 bits
-	double              64 bits

#### Characters:
-	char				16 bits

#### Booleans:
-	boolean				1 bit

## Referential Data Types/ ADT:
Referential data types have methods attached to them

-	String
-	Scanner
-	Program1
-	Integer
-	Long
-	Boolean
